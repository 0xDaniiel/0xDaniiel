This project implements a chatbot using OpenAI's GPT API. The chatbot is designed to engage in conversations with users, leveraging the power of natural language processing provided by OpenAI's GPT models.

## Features
- Interactive chatting experience with the chatbot
- Integration with OpenAI's GPT API for natural language processing
- Customizable responses and conversation flow

To get started with the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/1am-programmer/chatbot.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Obtain an API key from OpenAI and set it in your environment variables
4. Run the chatbot app: `npm run dev`

## Usage
Once the chatbot script is running, you can start interacting with the chatbot. Simply type your message and press enter to send it to the chatbot. The chatbot will respond accordingly based on the conversation context and the responses generated by the GPT model.
